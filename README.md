# pdashboard-connector
The **pdashboard-connector** is an **Application Lifecycle Management** (ALM) framework based on PSP development for Eclipse.

It provides:
 	
[ ] 1. The revolutionary task-focused interface
    [ ] 2. Realigns the IDE around tasks so that you see only the code that's relevant 
    3. A task management tool for developers 
    4. A broad ecosystem of **TSP/PSP** and ALM integrations. 
    5. Extensions integrate with ALM and developer collaboration tools 

>**pdashboard-connector's** task-focused interface reduces information overload and makes multitasking easy. The **pdashboard-connector** tool makes tasks a first class part of the IDE, integrates rich and offline editing for ALM tools, and monitors your programming activity to create a "task context" that focuses your workspace and automatically links all relevant work-products to the task-at-hand. This puts the information you need at your fingertips and improves productivity by reducing information overload, facilitating multitasking and easing the sharing of expertise with the [process dashboard tool](http://www.processdash.com/)
